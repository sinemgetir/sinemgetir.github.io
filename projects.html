	ENsurance of Software evolUtion by Run-time cErtification
	 </p>
	Software is an innovation driver in many different domains, e.g, 90% of the innovation in cars is realized by software. Hence, the quality of the software is of utmost importance and needs to be properly addressed during evolution. Examples of quality attributes which ENSURE-II addresses are safety in embedded systems and performance in business information systems. Currently, the quality is usually analyzed at design time under non-perfect knowledge about the behavior of the system and its environment which can result in incorrect analysis results.</p>
	Hence, ENSURE-II addresses this problem by a holistic model-driven approach, which treats quality evaluation models as first class entities. We focus on probabilistic quality properties, e.g., reliability, availability and safety. In the first phase, we developed a co-evolution approach for architectural as well as quality evaluation models which supports incremental change propagation between the models. This is complemented by an approach to efficiently learn the attributes of the quality evaluation models from the actual running system and an approach to specify the quality properties to analyze using controlled natural language. Complementary to these activities, we empirically studied model-driven engineering and its challenges related to our topics as well as how meta models of modeling languages evolve. We participated in both demonstrators, focussing on the Pick&amp;Place Unit (PPU), and evaluated our approach on the PPU case study</p>
	In the second phase, while addressing all three guiding themes of the SPP, we will focus more on the guiding theme of platforms and environments for evolution. We will specifically extend our co-evolution approach by providing recommendation support for cases where the co-evolution specifications do not provide deterministic co-evolution using machines learning techniques on model histories. The second major extension is exploiting the information from the model changes from the co-evolution for performance improvement of the quality analysis by an incremental approach. Finally, we will empirically study and evaluate the results from both phases with experts from industry as well as both demonstrators of the SPP. We will continue to be well integrated in the activities of the SPP.</p>

	A Domain Specific Modeling Language for Semantic Web 
enabled Multi-agent Systems
	 </p>
Software agents are considered to be autonomous entities which contain intelligence 
that  serves  for  solving  their  selfish  or  common  problems,  and  to  achieve  certain 
goals. These agents constitute Multi-agent Systems (MAS). However, the 
autonomous, responsive, and proactive natures of agents make the development of 
agent-based software systems more complex than other software systems. 
Furthermore,  the  design  and  implementation  of  a  MAS  may  become  even  more 
complex and difficult to implement when considering new requirements and 
interactions for new agent environments like the Semantic Web. Both domain-specific 
modeling and the  use of a domain-specific modeling language (DSML) may provide 
the  required  abstraction,  and  hence  support  a  more  fruitful  methodology  for  the 
development  of  MASs.  Within  this  context,  a  DSML  has  been  developed  for  the 
design and implementation of MAS with including all of its components and 
supporting  software  tools  in  this  project.  In  addition  to  the  classical  viewpoints  of  a 
MAS,  the  proposed  DSML  includes  new  viewpoints  which  specifically  support  the 
development of software agents working in the Semantic Web environment. At first, a 
metamodel and an abstract syntax were defined for the DSML. Later, both graphical 
and  textual  concrete  syntaxes  were  developed.  Upon  completion  of  the  formal 
definition of the semantics, operational semantics was derived via model 
transformations  in  order  to  provide  the  real  implementation  of  the  designed  MAS 
models. Codes for the agent software can be automatically achieved as the result of 
applying  model  to  code  transformations.  All  required  tools  for  MAS  modeling  and 
developing software according to the DSML were also constructed in this project. 	 </p>
